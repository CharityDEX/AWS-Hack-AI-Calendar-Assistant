CalendarAI is an AI-powered scheduling assistant that simplifies meeting arrangements. It integrates with Google Calendar, finds suitable time slots, manages email communications, and creates events. Users input requests via a chat interface, and the AI handles coordination, reducing the usual back-and-forth in scheduling.
